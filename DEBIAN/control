Description: Elegant and simple dock.
 Plank Reloaded is a fork of the original Plank project, focusing on Cinnamon
 desktop compatibility and modernized features. Like its predecessor, it aims to
 be the simplest dock on the planet, providing just what a dock needs and
 absolutely nothing more. It remains a library which can be extended to create
 other dock programs with more advanced features.
